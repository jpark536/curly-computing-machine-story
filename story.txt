A family gets on the plane for a trip to Europe, excited and thrilled. The dad, Alex, sits down next to his wife and dozes off to sleep right away.
 The mom, Angela, checks up on her kids in the aisle next to her and turns on a movie for the long flight. Soon, the plane takes off and the plane is on its way to France. 

Suddenly, the plane began to shake, as it began to pass through a thunder cloud. People were bracing themeselves in their seats, hoping the turbulence would end. A minute 
went by, then another, then another. Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the shaking stopped, and the plane was smooth until arrival.

However, Angela found something unusual; they have fish swimming around outside the plane's window.

A few seconds pass. Angela feels her chest pounding and starts gasping for air. Her mother is unresponsive, as she descends into the ocean, she imagines what her life could have been. The people she could have met, the person she could have become. In reality though, Angela isn't too angry, she hasn't lived long enough for it to be a worthwile investment

Angela looks at her mom, performing CPR on her, hoping she will wake. However, her mom stays unresponsive, laying on the sand, so still. 

Angela crouches down and starts sobbing, devestated. A few seconds pass and she opens her eyes.

She wakes up on her bed, sobbing. She looks around her familiar room, only to realize that she has been dreaming this whole time.
