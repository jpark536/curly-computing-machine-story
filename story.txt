A family gets on the plane for a trip to Europe, excited and thrilled. The dad, Alex, sits down next to his wife and dozes off to sleep right away.
 The mom, Angela, checks up on her kids in the aisle next to her and turns on a movie for the long flight. Soon, the plane takes off and the plane is on its way to France. 

Suddenly, the plane began to shake, as it began to pass through a thunder cloud. People were bracing themeselves in their seats, hoping the turbulence would end. A minute 
went by, then another, then another. Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the shaking stopped, and the plane was smooth until arrival.

However, Angela found something unusual; they have fish swimming around outside the plane's window.
